This is the entirety of the game's code and infrastructure, to view classes first unzip com.bushbot.maven.eclipse.zip and you can browse all files!

The application works by using the Discord4J package to use a listening Discord bot on any server as a responder when certain messages are sent and read. The users may play by
typing the specific commands into a channel in a server that has the bot able to view and comment, such as "!register" to register an account (the Discord ID is used to avoid creating
passwords and handling login/logout security), and players can interact with different parts of the game on certain timers like 5 minutes, 30 minutes, and daily! These currencies generated
by interacting can be spent to roll for characters and weapons, with the next planned update to be including group boss battles and a use for the upgraded characters and weapons!
